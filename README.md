## What is the Bevy LDtk Loader?

I am developing the Bevy LDtk Loader as a tool to load LDtk Levels into the Bevy game engine!

There are many projects out there which aim to do this as well. 

## License 

Released under the dual MIT and Apache licenses, as inspired by the Bevy team. 

## Getting Started

Add bevy_ldtk_asset to your Config.toml file, along with Bevy. We currently target Bevy version 0.12 .
